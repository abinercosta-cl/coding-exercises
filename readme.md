# Coding Exercises

Some exercises to train coding and logic skills.

## Tips and Notes

- **Yes, always english.** All content here will be written in english, a thing that can make you better at coding.
- **Some math.** Some problems require a basic or medium math level, so if you don't understand, go study and try again later.
- **RTFM.** Search, read docs and all posible text about a problem, read functions, code and all internet if needed.
- **Just solve the problem.** No matter how you solve, just do anything to solve a problem, try something, delete, do again, but just solve the problem.
- **A strongly typed language.** I recommend to use a language that require types, to force you to understand what you are doing. My personal choice is Go, Rust or C.

## Problems

- Easy (Just search some list on Google)
- [Medium](./problems/medium/)

## Submit

Submit your solutions to receive feedbacks. To submit follow this guide:

- Fork this repository.
- Create a folder with your github username inside the folder `solutions` (eg. `solutions/dreisss`).
- Inside this folder, put your solutions inside a folder with the problem identification (eg. `001_basic_recursion`) and create a pull request with your solutions.

To an example see the folder `solutions/dreisss/...`.
